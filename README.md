INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN GETH AND BESU NODES IN PERMISSIONED ETHEREUM NETWORKS. APPLICATION TO THE ALASTRIA T NETWORK.

Main points of the projects:
1. Explanation of the blockchain fundamentals and how blockchain technology works.
2. Explanation of the basic aspects of the Ethereum Network and explanation of the Alastria blockchain networks (T network and B network)
3. Deployment of an Alastria T testnet Network (blockchain nodes deployed using Geth (Go-Ethereum)) in a local environment.
4. Deployment of an Alastria B testnet Network (blockchain nodes deployed using Hyperledger Besu) in a local environment.
5. Deployment of an Alastria T testnet Network  but adding to this network Hyperledger Besu nodes to study the interoperability between Geth and Besu nodes.
